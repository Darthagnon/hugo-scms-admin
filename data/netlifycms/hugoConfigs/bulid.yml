    hint: Turn off writing a jsconfig.json into your /assets folder with mapping of
      imports from running js.Build. This file is intended to help with
      intellisense/navigation inside code editors such as VS Code. Note that if
      you do not use js.Build, no file will be written.

      Valid values are never, always and fallback. The last value means that the
      cache will be tried if PostCSS/extended version is not available.

    name: writeStats
    label: writeStats
    hint: When enabled, a file named hugo_stats.json will be written to your project
      root with some aggregated data about the build, e.g. list of HTML entities
      published to be used to do CSS pruning. If you’re only using this for the
      production build, you should consider placing it below config/production.
      It’s also worth mentioning that, due to the nature of the partial server
      builds, new HTML entities will be added when you add or change them while
      the server is running, but the old values will not be removed until you
      restart the server or run a regular hugo build.
