  The markdown widget provides a full fledged text editor allowing users to format text with features such as headings and blockquotes. Users can change their editing view with a handy toggle button.

  Please note: If you want to use your markdown editor to fill a markdown file contents after its frontmatter, you'll have to name the field body so the CMS recognizes it and saves the file accordingly.
