        hint: Regexp matching the Exif fields you want to exclude. This may be easier to
          use than IncludeFields above, depending on what you want.
      - field_type: string
        widget: string
        required: false
        name: includeFields
        label: includeFields
        hint: Regexp matching the fields you want to Exclude from the (massive) set of
          Exif info available. As we cache this info to disk, this is for
          performance and disk space reasons more than anything. If you want it all,
          put ".*" in this config setting. Note that if neither this or
          ExcludeFields is set, Hugo will return a small default set.
